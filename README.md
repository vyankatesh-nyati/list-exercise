## Description
In this project, I attempted to develop custom list functionality in Kotlin while closely sticking to the principals
of `Test-Driven Development`. The project was created without using the built-in `list` or any other methods from the
`Kotlin collection` library. Instead, I carefully designed all relevant list operations such as map, filter, reduce,
fold, drop, dropWhile, take, exists, etc. as extension functions.
